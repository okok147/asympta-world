# Asympta Kernel Recursive Lab — generation 87

Seed: `234681751`

## Process integrity

- Cases: **320**
- Completed: **27**
- Controlled / predictable failures: **293**
- Uncontrolled failures: **0**
- Process integrity rate: **100.00%**
- Deterministic replay rate: **100.00%**
- New uncontrolled fingerprints: **0**

A controlled failure is a valid terminal result. The lab only treats hangs, non-terminal stalls, nondeterminism, false completion, missing failure ownership/reason, or broken verification/handoff as kernel failures.

## Adaptive weights

Attack curriculum: controlled_no_capability=8.000, controlled_human_input=8.000, controlled_approval=8.000, novel_requirement=8.000, step_pressure=8.000, baseline_success=0.250, multilingual_noise=0.250, fallback_route=0.250, reordered_requirements=0.250, compound_noise=0.250

Repair priority: semantic=0.647, capability=0.647, liveness=0.647, approval=0.647, handoff=0.647, verification=0.647

## Repair contract

The repair loop must optimize **uncontrolled process-integrity failures**, not completion rate. It must not turn a predictable refusal, missing capability, human clarification, approval boundary, bounded timeout, or other controlled terminal failure into invented success.
